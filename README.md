# Python Small Projects 

Welcome to my Python small projects portfolio! 
This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I am developing while learning Python and working towards becoming a proficient developer.
Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.


## Projects

1. [Simple calculator](https://github.com/pgnikolov/python-small-projects/blob/main/simple_calculator.py) 
 
 - The program effectively performs basic arithmetic operations :heavy_plus_sign:	:heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x: :heavy_division_sign:
 - It showcases function definitions and error handling. 

2. [Calculator with GUI](https://github.com/pgnikolov/python-small-projects/tree/main/calculator_gui)
