Welcome to my Python small projects! 
This repository contains a collection of small projects that I am developing while learning Python.
Each project focuses on different aspects of Python programming, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Projects üóÉÔ∏è

1. [Password Generator](https://github.com/pgnikolov/python-small-projects/blob/main/password-gen.py) üîê
   - This Python script generates a random password based on user-specified criteria.
   - The user can specify the number of letters, symbols, and digits they want in their password, and the script will generate a password.

2. [Calculator with GUI](https://github.com/pgnikolov/python-small-projects/tree/main/calculator_gui) üßÆ
   - This Python code creates a simple calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the tkinter library.
   - The code displays a 2 textbox where users can enter their number.
   - Available arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, mod (%), ^ (square), ‚àö(square root))

3. [Instagram QR Code Generator](https://github.com/pgnikolov/python-small-projects/tree/main/qr_instagram) 
   - This Python script generates custom, Instagram-themed QR codes with gradient colors and an optional local logo. You can use it to create a visually appealing QR code that links directly to your Instagram profile.
